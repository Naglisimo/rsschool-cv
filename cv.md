#### About me

  I keep on career changing track! Firstly, in August of 2021 I had my first jump into the IT world, I was doing an internship at TIETOevry program "Month with IT". As for naive rookie programmer it was difficult, I managed to do around 4 tasks, but it showed me that I still need to learn hard. That s what I have been doing since. Regarding my experience I gained at TIETOevry was workflow with Agile methodology and programing skills with ReactJS, TypeScript, Git, ANDT components library.
Recently I ve participated in Teltonika IoT academy, as front end intern! This time I was much more prepared and did better work. Of course, I had challenges too. To
understand new framework VueJS 2 and VUCI, which is a web user interface built for Openwrt routers which is based on Vue.js framework. With the time I became more 
confident with programming and much more excited while finding ways to connect my knowledge! Looking forward to the adventures ahead.
